# 💉 Immunization Tracker (Python Beginner Project)

This is a simple terminal-based app that lets users track vaccine patients. It's built in Python and is part of my journey to become a skilled developer with real GitHub projects and Azure deployments.

## 🧠 What It Does

- Checks if a patient is eligible based on age
- Confirms if the patient has an appointment
- Takes vaccine type and date
- Saves all patient info to a file (`patients.json`)
- Loads and displays summary if you choose to review it

## 🧰 Skills I Used

- Python functions and if/else logic  
- Loops, lists, and dictionaries  
- User input and input validation  
- File saving and reading with JSON  
- Modular programming (splitting code into files)  
- Try/except error handling  
- Basic API call (CDC vaccine trends)  
- GitHub version control (pushed daily)

## 🏁 How to Run It

In the terminal:

```bash
python main.py
